# Project Overview: Inventory Monitoring at Distribution Centers
Distribution centers often use robots to move objects as a part of their operations. Objects are carried in bins which can contain multiple objects. In this project, you will have to build a model that can count the number of objects in each bin. A system like this can be used to track inventory and make sure that delivery consignments have the correct number of items.

To build this project you will use AWS SageMaker and good machine learning engineering practices to fetch data from a database, preprocess it, and then train a machine learning model. This project will serve as a demonstration of end-to-end machine learning engineering skills that you have learned as a part of this nanodegree.

# Source files
This project is based on the Udatity starter files avaiable [here](https://github.com/udacity/nd009t-capstone-starter). 

# Project files structure
In the git repository there are two main directories: 
- project_proposal -- contain Latex document with the proposal file describint project overview
- project -- actual project code which can be executed on AWS or standalone to reach the project's goals.

This readme describe just general background for the project.
For the project files description please refer to [`README.md`](project/README.md).  file in the `project/` directory.
